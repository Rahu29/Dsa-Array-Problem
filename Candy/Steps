Problem statement->

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array arr[].
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating than their neighbors get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution Steps ->

1) Create a function called minCandy(int arr[]) which will return int and take parameter int[] arr.
2) Craete a temp[] of same length as arr[] has;
3) Run a 'for' loop and Assign initial values '1' to temp[] array, which will fulfill our condition (Each user must contain excatly one candy).
4) Run second 'for' loop from index 1 to last -
    1) Check if current element is greater than previous element,
        if condition true then increase the value of temp[i](current element in temp[] array)
        to temp[i-1]+1(this will fullfill condition to get candy more than previous one).
5) Run third 'for' loop from arr.length -2 to 0 -
    1) Check if current element is greate than the next element,
        if condition true then consider max value between (temp[i] and temp[i+1]+1), we are doing this because we have added values in temp[] previously while going left to right.
6) At last, Run fourth 'for' loop and do sum of all numbers and store it in a res variable.
7) Return res;
8) END
