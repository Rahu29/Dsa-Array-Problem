238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution ->
1) Create productExceptSelf() method with argument int[] nums and return type as int[].
2) Create 3 variables -
    1) int product - to store whole product of arr element except 0.
    2) boolean is0Contains - to check if array contains zero.
    3) int zeroCount - To check how many time zero comes in array. If there are greater than one zero then definately product of all arr element except self is zero.
3)  Run a for loop till last element in nums -\
    1) Check condition if current element is 0 or not -
        1) If true then set is0Contains to true.
        2) Increase count of zeroCount variable by one.
        3) Check the condition if zeroCount is greater than 1 then definately product of all element becomes zero.\
            1) Break the loop.
    2) If above condition false then Check the condition in else block that if product is equal to zero -
        1) If true then set product equal to 1. If we dont do this then the last resyult will be zero0 always.
        2) set product value equal to product*current_element.
4) Run another for loop from 0 to length of nums -
    1) Check condition if zeroCount > 1 -
        1) If true then definately last result is 0 for all element so set nums[i] is 0.
        2) We dont want something else will execute in this condition so continue for loop using "Continue" statement.
    2) Check another condition if is0Contains is true-
        1) Check condition if current element is 0 -
            1) set current element i.e. nums[i] is equal to product.
        2) Else set current element equal to 0.
    3) If above condition fails then in else block set current element equal to product/nums[i].
5) return nums
6) END.

Debugging Steps ->

First loop (calculate product & zero info)
    Iteration n = 1
        n != 0
        product == 0 → set product = 1
        product = product * 1 → product = 1
    Iteration n = 2
        n != 0
        product = 1 * 2 → product = 2
    Iteration n = 3
        n != 0
        product = 2 * 3 → product = 6
    Iteration n = 4
        n != 0
        product = 6 * 4 → product = 24

After first loop:
product = 24
zeroCount = 0
is0Contains = false

Second loop (build result in same array)
    Iteration i = 0
        zeroCount > 1 → false
        is0Contains → false
        nums[i] = product / nums[i] → 24 / 1 = 24
    Iteration i = 1
        nums[i] = 24 / 2 = 12
    Iteration i = 2
        nums[i] = 24 / 3 = 8
    Iteration i = 3
        nums[i] = 24 / 4 = 6

Final Res = nums = [24, 12, 8, 6]
