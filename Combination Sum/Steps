Leetcode-39
Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.
The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.
Example 1:

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution ->
1) Craete a function called combinationSum() which will take two param int array of candidates and int target.
2) Sort the array in ascending order, and this is the key step.
3) Create List<List<Integer>> res for storing final res.
4) Now call another function called combination() whose return type is void and will take param as below-
    1) int[] arr - this is the orginal array.
    2) int start - use to know starting point
    3) int remainingTarget - Used to know how much target is remaining.
    4) List<Integer> path - Used to store current element if it is small than the remainingTarget.
    5) List<List<Integer>> res - Used to store final res if remainingTarget == 0.
5) Call combination() from combinationSum() and pass param values as below -
    1) Actual array
    2) '0' as a start value
    3) Actual target
    4) new ArrayList<>() for path
    5) List<List<Integer>> for res
6) Return res from combinationSum().
7) In combination() check condition if remainingTarget is equal to zero if so -
    1) Add copy of current path to res i.e res.add(new ArrayList<>(path)).
    2) Return.
8) If remainingTarget is not equal to zero then -
    1) Run a for loop starting from start to arr.length -
        1) Check condition if remainingTarget is less than current element i.e arr[i] -
            1) Break loop.
        2) If above(8.1.1) condition breaks then add current variable in path.
        3) Call same function (combination()) recursively and pass param as below -
            1) Actual array i.e arr.
            2) Current index(i) as start.
            3) remainingTarget - arr[i]
            4) path
            5) res
        4) Remove last element from path i.e path.remove(path.size()-1).
9) END
